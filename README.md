# Monitoring-Network-Traffic-Snort-IDS
Designing four different Snort scans to detect ping scans, SSH logins, Xmas scans, and FTP failed login attempts.

Tools utilized: Kali Linux, Metasploitable2, Wireshark, Nmap

An intrusion detection system (IDS) will monitor network traffic and send an alert when it detects suspicious activity occurring over the network. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) will work to counteract an attack that is currently taking place to prevent it from reaching the network. The Snort tool can be used to set up both an IDS and an IPS to protect either a particular host system or a network.
