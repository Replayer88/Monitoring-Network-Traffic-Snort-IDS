# You should see two rules:

# Send out the alert onto the console by using the snort.conf configuration file 
# Logs will be stored in the logs directory while scanning traffic on the network interface
sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l logs -i eth1

# Create the Xmas scan with Nmap in a different terminal
# In the pcap file, the target IP address is 192.168.187.128
sudo nmap -sX [TARGET.IP.ADDRESS]

# We can see the detection in the terminal window running the Snort command
# You should see "SCAN nmap XMAS" on the alerts
